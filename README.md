BrightWater is a E-commerce website challege completed with commerce.js API, react and Sass for styling. I've also used some aditional libraries on the side for animations like intersection observer.

The live website can be found here: https://dashing-macaron-063b59.netlify.app/

Before starting the project I've gathered some resources and planned out the use journey.
